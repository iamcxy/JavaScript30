## CSS Variables

`document.querySelectorAll()` returns a list of elements not an array, the array objects contains more built-in functions. Listen to `change` and `mouseover` events, as `mouseover` would be able to listen to the range bar while on mouse dragging. 

`this.dataset` returns DOMStringMap of all the data attributes, such as `data-sizing` which we used to store the suffix of spacing and blur value. When accessed attribute does not exist in the dataset object, object will return `undefined` to the variable reference. Empty string `''` is used as safe fallback because the color input doesn't have sizing otherwise we would append `undefined`

`document.documentElement.style.setProperty();` would retrieve the style of root element and set the property. 

`attribute:name` in `<input>` tag is used as reference as to which css var to set when the input(base color, blue, spacing) value is changed.
